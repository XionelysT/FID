<br><h2>Low and Slow</h2></br>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In <dfn>sous vide</dfn> cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks,</cite> Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time></p>
