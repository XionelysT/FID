<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="three burgers on wooden board"></a></br>
<p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="salmon elegantly plated"></a><br>
<p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="chicken tenders in paper basket"></a><br>
<p>All of our chicken is farm-raised with no antibiotics ensuring the freshest and tastiest chicken. Our chicken tenders are lightly breaded and fried in Canola Oil, and served with a side of your choice.</p>

<h2>Our Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="plate of fries and ketchup"></a><br>
<p> Just like our tenders, our fries are fried in fresh Canola Oil. You can order them as a side or as an appetizer, making them the perfect dish for sharing with friends or family, or just for yourself.</p>

<h2>Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="tabouleh in cylindrical shape"></a><br>
<p>Our Tabouleh is made up of ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, parsley, and mint. All of our salad ingredients are picked to the freshest quality. Tabouleh is the perfect side when you want something refreshing and filling.</p>
